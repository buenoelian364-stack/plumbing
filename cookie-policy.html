                    <h2>What Are Cookies</h2>
                    <p>Cookies are small text files placed on a device by websites during visits. These files contain information that can be read by the website on subsequent visits. Cookies serve various purposes including remembering settings, tracking navigation patterns, and enabling certain website features.</p>
                    <p>This website uses a limited number of cookies for essential functions. The specific types and purposes are described in detail below.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="policy-section">
                    <h2>Types of Cookies Used</h2>

                    <h3>Strictly Necessary Cookies</h3>
                    <p>These cookies are required for the website to function properly. Without them, certain features would not work. Strictly necessary cookies include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Session identifier:</strong> Maintains your browsing session as you navigate between pages, ensuring the website recognizes you as the same visitor during your visit</li>
                        <li><strong>Form state:</strong> Remembers information you have entered into forms so it is not lost if you navigate away and return</li>
                        <li><strong>Security tokens:</strong> Prevents cross-site request forgery and other security vulnerabilities when submitting forms</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Duration: Session cookies expire when you close your browser. Some may persist for up to 24 hours to maintain session continuity.</p>

                    <h3>Functional Cookies</h3>
                    <p>Functional cookies enhance website features by remembering choices you have made. These are optional and improve user experience but are not essential:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Preference storage:</strong> Remembers if you have dismissed informational banners or notices so they do not repeatedly appear</li>
                        <li><strong>Accessibility settings:</strong> Stores choices about text size or contrast if such features are available</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Duration: Functional cookies typically remain for 30 to 90 days or until manually cleared from your browser.</p>

                    <h3>Analytics Cookies</h3>
                    <p>Limited analytics may be collected to understand how the website is used. This information is aggregated and does not identify individual visitors:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Page view tracking:</strong> Records which pages are visited to identify popular content and areas needing improvement</li>
                        <li><strong>Traffic source:</strong> Notes how visitors arrive at the site such as through search, direct navigation, or referral links</li>
                        <li><strong>Device and browser type:</strong> Collects basic technical information to ensure the website functions properly across different platforms</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Duration: Analytics cookies may remain for up to one year but contain no personally identifiable information.</p>
                    <p>Analytics can be disabled through browser settings or opt-out mechanisms without affecting core website functionality.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="policy-section">

                <div class="policy-section">
                    <h2>Managing Cookie Preferences</h2>
                    <p>You have control over cookie acceptance and can manage preferences through several methods:</p>

                    <h3>Browser Settings</h3>
                    <p>All modern browsers allow you to control cookie behavior through settings. You can:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Block all cookies from all websites</li>
                        <li>Block third-party cookies while allowing first-party cookies</li>
                        <li>Block cookies from specific websites</li>
                        <li>Delete all existing cookies from your device</li>
                        <li>Receive notifications before cookies are placed</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Instructions for managing cookies vary by browser. Consult your browser's help documentation for specific steps. Common browsers include Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and others.</p>

                    <h3>Website Cookie Banner</h3>
                    <p>When you first visit this website, a cookie notification may appear allowing you to accept or decline optional cookies. Strictly necessary cookies will function regardless of your choice, as they are required for the website to operate.</p>
                    <p>Your cookie preferences are remembered for future visits. You can change your preferences at any time by clearing cookies from your browser, which will cause the banner to appear again on your next visit.</p>

                    <h3>Opt-Out Mechanisms</h3>
                    <p>For analytics cookies, you may use browser-based opt-out tools or privacy extensions that block tracking scripts. When analytics are blocked, the website continues to function normally but usage statistics are not collected from your visits.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="policy-section">
                    <h2>Global Privacy Control Recognition</h2>
                    <p>This website recognizes Global Privacy Control signals sent by browsers. When GPC is enabled, optional analytics and non-essential cookies are automatically disabled. The website respects this preference without requiring additional action on your part.</p>
                    <p>Strictly necessary cookies may still be used when GPC is active, as they are required for basic website function and fall within legally permitted uses even when general tracking is declined.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="policy-section">
                    <h2>Effect of Blocking Cookies</h2>
                    <p>Blocking or deleting cookies will have the following effects:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Strictly necessary cookies blocked:</strong> Some website features may not function properly, including form submission and navigation between pages while maintaining session state</li>
                        <li><strong>Functional cookies blocked:</strong> Preference settings will not be remembered between visits, and informational banners may appear on every visit</li>
                        <li><strong>Analytics cookies blocked:</strong> No impact on website functionality; only prevents collection of aggregated usage statistics</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You can test the website with different cookie settings to determine which combination provides your preferred balance of functionality and privacy.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="policy-section">
                    <h2>Cookie Lifespan and Renewal</h2>
                    <p>Different cookies have different lifespans:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Session cookies:</strong> Expire when you close your browser or after a period of inactivity, typically 30 minutes to 2 hours</li>
                        <li><strong>Persistent cookies:</strong> Remain on your device for a set period ranging from days to months, as described in the cookie type sections above</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Cookies may be renewed during subsequent visits to extend their validity period. Clearing cookies from your browser permanently deletes them regardless of their intended lifespan.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="policy-section">
                    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
                    <p>This website does not load third-party scripts or services that would place their own cookies. All cookies used originate from this website domain only.</p>
                    <p>If future changes introduce third-party services, this policy will be updated to describe what those services are, what cookies they use, and how to control them.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="policy-section">

Significant changes that introduce new types of cookies or tracking mechanisms will be communicated through website notices.</p>
