                        <p>Technicians working on residential water systems hold appropriate licenses as required by Florida regulations. This includes state licensing through the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation, which involves examination and demonstration of knowledge about plumbing codes, practices, and safety procedures.</p>
                        <p>Continuing education is part of license maintenance. This involves completing courses on code updates, new materials and techniques, safety practices, and other relevant topics. The state requires ongoing education to maintain active license status.</p>
                        <p>Familiarity with various system types and components is developed through hands-on experience with different situations. This includes working with different pipe materials, fixture types, water heater varieties, and diagnostic equipment.</p>
                        <p>Technicians are trained in the use of diagnostic tools such as pressure gauges, leak detection equipment, pipe cameras, and flow meters. These tools help in identifying the nature and location of concerns within water systems.</p>
                        <p>Insurance coverage is maintained as required for service operations. This includes liability coverage and workers compensation, providing protection for both service providers and property owners.</p>
