                    <div class="overview-text">
                        <p>A typical residential water system consists of several interconnected components that work together to deliver clean water to fixtures and remove wastewater from the property. Understanding these components helps in maintaining proper system function.</p>
                        <p>The supply system brings water into the home from either a municipal connection or a private well. Water travels through a main supply line, passes through a meter (for municipal systems), and may flow through a pressure regulator before distributing to various fixtures throughout the home.</p>
                        <p>The distribution network consists of pipes that branch from the main supply line to reach different areas of the home. Cold water lines deliver water directly to fixtures, while a branch feeds the water heater for hot water distribution.</p>
                        <p>The drain-waste-vent system removes wastewater and prevents sewer gases from entering living spaces. Drain pipes slope downward to allow gravity flow, carrying wastewater to the main sewer line or septic system. Vent pipes allow air into the system, preventing vacuum formation that would slow drainage.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Seasonal Maintenance Considerations</h2>
                <div class="seasonal-content">
                    <div class="seasonal-text">
                        <h3>Cold Weather Preparations</h3>
                        <p>In areas where temperatures drop below freezing, protecting pipes from cold is important. Exterior faucets should be drained and shut off from inside the home. Pipes in unheated areas such as crawl spaces, attics, or exterior walls may need insulation. Allowing faucets to drip slightly during extreme cold helps prevent freezing.</p>

                        <h3>Warm Weather Checks</h3>
                        <p>Warmer months are appropriate for checking outdoor plumbing components. This includes inspecting hose bibs, irrigation systems, and pool plumbing if applicable. It is also a suitable time to check for leaks that may have developed during winter.</p>

                        <h3>Year-Round Maintenance</h3>
                        <p>Some maintenance activities apply throughout the year. These include monitoring for leaks, checking water pressure, listening for unusual sounds from fixtures or pipes, and noting any changes in water quality or flow. Addressing minor concerns promptly may prevent them from developing into larger issues.</p>

                        <h3>Water Heater Maintenance</h3>
                        <p>Water heaters function more consistently when maintained periodically. This includes draining a few gallons from the tank to remove sediment, testing the pressure relief valve, checking the anode rod condition (for tank models), and verifying temperature settings. Manufacturer guidelines provide specific maintenance recommendations.</p>
