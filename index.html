                        <h3>Leak Detection</h3>
                        <p>Water leaks can occur in various locations throughout a home. Common areas include under sinks, around toilets, at pipe connections, and within walls. Indicators may include water stains, dampness, or unusual water meter readings when fixtures are not in use.</p>

                        <h3>Drain Systems</h3>
                        <p>Drain systems transport wastewater from fixtures to the main sewer line. Blockages can develop from accumulated material such as hair, soap residue, food particles, or mineral deposits. Regular maintenance of drain components may help maintain proper flow.</p>

                        <h3>Water Pressure</h3>
                        <p>Water pressure in residential systems typically ranges between 40 and 60 PSI. Variations in pressure can result from municipal supply changes, pipe diameter, elevation differences, or partial blockages. Pressure regulators help maintain consistent levels.</p>

                        <h3>Water Heaters</h3>
                        <p>Water heaters provide hot water for household use. Systems include tank-style and tankless varieties. Regular maintenance considerations include temperature settings, sediment accumulation, anode rod condition, and pressure relief valve function.</p>

                        <h2>Service Process Overview</h2>
                        <p>When addressing water system concerns, a structured approach is typically followed. The process begins with initial contact and description of the situation. This is followed by scheduling a convenient time for inspection.</p>
                        <p>During the inspection phase, the technician examines the relevant components, identifies the nature of the concern, and documents findings. This may involve visual examination, testing of fixtures, pressure measurements, or use of diagnostic equipment such as cameras or leak detection devices.</p>
                        <p>After assessment, the technician provides information about the situation and discusses potential approaches. This includes explaining what was found, what options are available, and what each option involves. Time estimates and cost considerations are also part of this discussion.</p>
                        <p>The implementation phase involves carrying out the agreed-upon work. This may include repairs, replacements, or adjustments to system components. Work is performed according to relevant codes and standards.</p>
                        <p>Upon completion, the technician reviews the work performed, tests the system to verify proper function, and provides information about what was done. This may include recommendations for ongoing maintenance or areas to monitor.</p>
